    "Multithreading is a way to concurrently run multiple threads. Threads are smaller units of a process. In Python, threading is mostly used for I/O-bound tasks, such as downloading files, reading from disk, or network operations, because Python threads are not well-suited for CPU-bound tasks due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, print_numbers and print_letters are each run in their own thread. This means they will execute concurrently, leading to a mixed output of numbers and letters. The order of the output will likely be different each time the program is run because the threads are being scheduled to run by the operating system and may not start or finish at exactly the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should be aware that multithreading in Python doesn't actually result in true parallel execution due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). Python's GIL is a mutex (or a lock) that allows only one thread to execute at a time in a single process. Python uses the GIL to simplify memory management and to avoid conflicts among threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "For CPU-bound tasks where you do need parallelism, you should use multiprocessing (which involves separate processes, each with its own Python interpreter and its own GIL) instead of multithreading. You might also consider using a native extension such as Numba or Cython, or a different language that supports true multithreading.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that multithreading can make a program more complex and more difficult to debug. It can lead to issues with shared state (where one thread changes a value another thread was expecting) and can cause race conditions, where the behavior of your program depends on the exact timing of events, which is generally not predictable. Before using multithreading, it's worth considering if there's a way to achieve the same result with simpler code."
